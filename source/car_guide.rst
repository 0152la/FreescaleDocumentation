How to assemble your Freescale Cup car
======================================

The car provided to you requires some assembly before you're able to properly use it in the competition. In particular, you will need to add the servo, the FRDM-KL25Z board and the camera, on a custom made mount.

Please note that this document is meant only to guide you and presents only one way to build everything together. If you are so inclined, feel free to change things as you like, especially for the board and camera mount. However, do keep in mind that:

* You will need to connect the camera, servo and battery pack to the FRDM-KL25Z board;
* All the components should be tightly fitted to the car so they won't get thrown off during the actual race.

The contents of the smaller box are the actual car, a bag with screws, nuts and more and a second bag with pieces to help you assemble your car. The screwdriver is not included, but you will need it to get everything together.

Installing the servo
--------------------

The first step is installing the servo. This process is more or less set in stone, but there are certain points where you can get creative.

First, take out the servo and the four yellow plastic pieces presented below.

Then, combine the yellow parts as below:

Unscrew the black connector from the servo and replace it with the yellow one you just made. Use the same screw and remember to add in the small yellow piece to fasten everything together.
